I’m a test automation engineer and a QA team leader. In my day-to-day work, I’m using technologies such as Docker, ELK stack, shell, node, and python scripting, and TestCafe to solve any automation problems that come my way. My abilities extend beyond test automation. My main mission is to boldly automate what hasn’t been automated before 🖖. Whether it’s tests, or CD pipeline, or reporting platform. I’m also a docker evangelist 🐳. I believe that there’s no automation problem that can’t be solved with the use of docker. As a team leader, my focus is on education and communication. Never have I passed the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience. The most rewarding thing for me is when people find useful something that I taught.

<center><h3>on a more personal note 🙋‍♂️</h3></center>

I'm a typical human, full of inconsistencies and contradictions 🤷‍♂️. A husband, a dog owner 🐶, a gamer, an AFOL, an apprentice philosopher, and a vegetarian 🌱 among many other things. I go where my interests take me. Never afraid to explore new frontiers 🚀. Always wanting to learn new things, always looking for the open source alternatives, always very excited about Apple products 😅. My latest quirks are Raspberry Pi projects and comic books (The Walking Dead 🧟‍♀️, Ms Marvel ⚡️).
