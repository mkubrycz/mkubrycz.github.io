I‚Äôm a QA Automation Engineer who loves working with web technologies. I‚Äôve used a bunch of JavaScript-based testing tools and frameworks, like Playwright, TestCafe, k6, and Cypress. I‚Äôm also familiar with mobile test automation. But I‚Äôm not just about QA automation. I work with a wide variety of technologies every day. From Docker to Kubernetes and Grafana, to Go, I‚Äôm always looking for new tools to help me solve automation problems at hand. I‚Äôm on a mission to boldly automate what hasn‚Äôt been automated before! üññ I love a good challenge, whether it‚Äôs automating tests, building CD pipelines, or integrating new data analysis platforms for better observability. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I especially enjoy helping others learn and grow their skills and knowledge. In the past, I‚Äôve been a mentor to many QA engineers, and it‚Äôs so profoundly rewarding to see my mentee learn something new and understand a new concept. üë®‚Äçüè´ I also love learning new and valuable skills, especially those that can make our daily lives easier.

I‚Äôm a jack-of-all-trades and a master of fun! I‚Äôm a husband, a dog dad üêï, a gamer üïπÔ∏è, a huge Lego enthusiast, a budding philosopher, and a vegan ü•ë. I follow my passions wherever they take me. I‚Äôm always up for exploring new things and learning new skills. I‚Äôm also always on the hunt for the latest software, and I‚Äôm particularly excited about Apple products. Lately, I‚Äôve been getting into building my own Lego side business, training my furry friend, and reading an amazing comic book series called DMZ. Highly recommend it! ü§ì
