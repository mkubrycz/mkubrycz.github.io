Wow, that wasn't easy! 😅 Even though GitHub Pages are so easy to configure and deploy it took me over a month to set everything up and write this "{{ page.title }}" post. I couldn't just have created it and let it be. I had to check out almost every Jekyll theme available before I chose this one. Of course, I had to understand the inner workings of Jekyll. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night otherwise. Then, I had to decide what I wanted to write here. Not that I didn't already know, I just had to crystallize my ideas. Next, I began to see all those little things that, I thought, could be done better. Like adding a little color here and there. I had to change layouts, add some icons, drop caps... Does this count for OCD yet? I think so. 🤓 But finally, my own blog goes live! Exciting! 🙃

## but wait, why is this blog happening? 🤔

Honestly? I wanted to create an online resume. It got out of hand. Slightly... 🤭

I could've put a static page with an image or something somewhere and call it a day, I know. But I couldn't. I thought of "the best" way of creating one's resume. Markdown! 🙄 It's simple, easily editable and can be interpreted as an HTML page without any effort. Once again, I could've created a repo on GitHub, put my resume written in markdown there and call it a day.

Yeah, too simple! 😑

Then it came to me, blog! 💡 I should create a personal blog and include my resume there! 🤯

I know...

That being said this might even be the only post I write here. But I achieved my goal. My resume is now online. 🎉

## but there's more to it

All this didn't happen without making numerous plans for the blog, so I might as well share them here. Maybe at some point, I will look back at this and... well, have a laugh? I mean, feel proud of my creation! 😅

## the numerous plans

**Writing**, especially in English. As this is my second language and there's always a lot to improve on. Simple. 👏

**Learning** through explaining things. Blog posts seem to be a suitable mean to this. And there's always the advantage of not having to repeat yourself. 😄 Other than that, putting my thoughts in writing and releasing them into an endless void of the internet gives me that sense of being responsible for my words. Anyone can now call me on anything I write here. Whether my audience is imaginary or real, the feeling of responsibility persists. 🤪

**A place to vent**. There are a lot of topics that I'm passionate about. Sometimes, some of them are worth sharing or having a discussion about. This would be the place to do that. I don't mean to write about just anything that comes to my mind at any time, no. 😅 I imagine keeping this place more or less oriented around my professional life as a software tester and programmer with a pinch of digression here and there. 👌

## that's it

Yes! 🙌 So, hello world, how are you?
